3b. Modify the program such that the user can enter a minimum and a
maximum velocity (vmin, vmax) from standard input. The program should
explore the time taken "t" for a number of 10 bins in initial velocity that
cover the range between vmin and vmax (please take bins equally spaced).
The result should be kept in an ascii file. Additionally, the program should
create and save a plot showing the time “t" as a function of “v_init”, where
v_init is the initial velocity. (x-axis = v_init, y-axis = t).
